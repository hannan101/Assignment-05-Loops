# Assignment-05-Loops
Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. The for loop is typically used to iterate over sequences, such as lists or strings, while the while loop continues as long as a specified condition is true. Both types of loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and controlling the flow of programs.
